## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – semantic and accessible markup
- **CSS3** – animations, flexbox layout, transitions
- **SCSS** – modular structure with variables, mixins, and partials
- **BEM methodology** – consistent class naming and reusable components
- **SVG sprite system** – for icons and interaction symbols
- **Google Fonts** – Open Sans for clean, professional typography

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Modular SCSS architecture**: partials like `_layout.scss`, `_components.scss`, `_base.scss`
- **Dashboard-style layout**: custom grid with flexible and responsive side panels
- **Icon management**: using a single sprite file for performance
- **No JavaScript**: all UI built purely with HTML and CSS
- **Visual hierarchy**: structured spacing, typography, and component scaling
